# L-system Prototype
A prototype to test a few ideas.

## L-system
An [L-system][l-system] or Lindenmyer-system is a

> parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht.

## Goal
Inspired by the [Fractal Tree][video] coding challenge, we want to recreate that image with Rust. Furthermore we want to explore ways of working with L-systems in such a way that is is easy to change a visualization methods.
